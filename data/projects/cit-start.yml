  - title: Towards Meaningful and Real Refactoring Operations
    description: Up to 75% of the cost of designing a software system can be attributed to post-deployment maintenance and evolution. In this context, Software Refactoring can lower these expenses by raising the software quality. Software Refactoring has several advantages, but its process can be difficult, error-prone, and time-consuming. Thus, automated refactoring tools have been proposed in the literature aiming to deal with these tasks. However, the state-of-the-art tools still lack trustworthiness when suggesting refactorings. In some cases, the recommended refactorings are inadequate or invalid (e.g., if applied, they can affect the codeâ€™s functionality and understanding), leading to developers avoiding such automated tools. Part of this problem is the lack of a comprehensive set of pre-conditions (or rules) used to derive the refactoring recommendation(s). In some cases, these sets of conditions are so simple (or naive) that the refactoring recommendation does not make sense and the developers avoid them and, as a consequence, the automated tools that generate them
