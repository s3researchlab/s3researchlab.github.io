name: Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP)
description: The Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) is designed to support collaborations between UM-Flint undergraduate students and faculty researchers. UROP allows students to earn paid (or volunteer) hands-on research experience working alongside faculty on cutting-edge projects.

  - title: Arduino-powered Autonomous 'Follow Me' Car With Obstacle Avoidance
    description: An autonomous “Follow me” car is a self-driving vehicle that can navigate itself without human intervention to follow a person wherever he/she moves. Complex autonomous driving algorithms, including perception, localization, planning, and control, are needed for autonomous driving, along with a wide variety of heterogeneous sensors, actuators, and computers. In this project, the students will build a prototype for an autonomous “follow me” car powered by Arduino. By using ultrasound sensors and actuators as electric motors, the car will follow a person through GPS location avoiding obstacles by predicting the safest pathway to reach the target. The students will read research papers on predictive models by using machine learning and implement them in the car. The data collected by the ultrasound sensors will be used for training and validation. Experiments will be carried out to compare the performance by using a naive avoidance algorithm (such as those using if-statements) against predictive models.

  - title: Mining and Data Analysis on GitHub Repositories
    description: GitHub is the largest source code repository built on top of Git (a version control system). In the last years, a number of research papers have been published reporting findings based on data mined from GitHub. Because of that, the software community continues to improve its understanding of software engineering thanks to the analysis performed on this platform. In this project, the students will have the opportunity to learn how to create datasets with data extracted from GitHub's API and apply some data analysis techniques (for instance, clustering and decision tree algorithms) to classify such data.

  - title: Selecting the best set of software requirements for the next software release by using optimization algorithms
    url: https://umflint.infoready4.com/#competitionDetail/1891856
    targets:
      - undergraduate
    description: The selection of the requirements to be included in the next software release is a complex task in every software development, mainly because it addresses several conflicting goals and limited resources, such as available time, budget, and software developers. Hence, the best set of requirements to be implemented in the next release needs to be selected. This project aims to identify which conflicting attributes a requirement has before being selected and then apply optimization algorithms to select the best subset of software requirements. The students will also learn about the optimization research area and they will implement their own genetic algorithm (GA)
