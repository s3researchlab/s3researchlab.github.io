In this project, the students will build a prototype for an autonomous “follow me” car powered by Arduino. By using ultrasound sensors and actuators as electric motors, the car will follow a person through GPS location avoiding obstacles by predicting the safest pathway to reach the target. The students will read research papers on predictive models by using machine learning and implement them in the car.
